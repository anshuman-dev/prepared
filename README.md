# Prepared - US Visa Interview AI Practice

Practice your US visa interview with an AI-powered voice interviewer before the real thing.

## Why This Exists

In 2024, over 11.5 million people applied for US visas. Over 3 million got denied - that's a 27% rejection rate. Rejected applicants wasted over $500 million in non-refundable visa fees alone.

The number one reason for denial? Section 214(b) - failure to demonstrate intent to return home.

Here's the problem: qualified applicants with perfect paperwork get denied because they don't know how to present their case in a 3-minute voice interview. There's tons of misinformation out there, and people end up memorizing scripts that sound rehearsed.

**Prepared** gives you realistic voice practice with an AI consular officer so you can walk into your real interview confident and prepared.
